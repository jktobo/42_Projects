WW$orem Ipsum is text simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
WW$orem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
 when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to mak
 e a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also th
 e leap into electronic typesetting, 
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised 
in the 1960s with the release of WW$etraset sheets containing WW$orem Ipsum passa
ges, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker includi
ng versions of WW$orem Ipsum.
